<h2> 🖋️ Project Description 🖋️ </h2>

> This project is a **UI clone of the HBO Max website**, developed with the purpose of reproducing the original platform’s interface while applying front-end development best practices.

The application focuses exclusively on **visual and structural reproduction**, including layout, animations, responsiveness, and user interface behaviors.  
No API integrations were implemented, as the main objective is to explore **CSS fundamentals and modern layout techniques**.

Some visual elements were adapted and customized to reinforce learning and experimentation, rather than creating a pixel-perfect copy.

<h2> 🖌️ Project Styling 🖌️ </h2>

The project’s visual identity follows the **official HBO Max color palette**, preserving its dark, cinematic aesthetic combined with vibrant accent colors.

Typography choices were carefully selected to maintain visual hierarchy and readability across different screen sizes:

- **Headings:** *Raleway, sans-serif*  
- **Body text:** *Quicksand, sans-serif*

The interface was designed using a **mobile-first approach**, ensuring consistency and usability on:

- **Small screens (mobile):** 360px  
- **Medium screens (tablet):** 768px  
- **Large screens (desktop):** 1440px

<h3> 💭 Project Concept 💭 </h3>

The concept behind this project is to simulate a real-world streaming platform interface while reinforcing core front-end skills.  
By cloning a well-known product like HBO Max, the project allows deeper understanding of layout composition, spacing, visual rhythm, and UI consistency.

This approach also mirrors common industry challenges, where developers must replicate or maintain existing design systems with high fidelity.

<h2> 📚 Concepts Applied 📚 </h2>

This project was developed to practice and reinforce several front-end concepts, including:

- CSS fundamentals  
- CSS Grid Layout  
- Flexbox  
- Responsive design principles  
- Pseudo-elements  
- Pseudo-classes  
- 2D and 3D transformations  
- Transitions and animations  
- Handling invalid form fields with CSS

<h2> 🧗‍♂️ Challenges Faced During Development 🧗‍♂️ </h2>

One of the main challenges of this project was achieving a responsive layout that remained visually consistent across different screen sizes while preserving the original design’s structure.

Additionally, reproducing animations, hover effects, and visual transitions required careful attention to detail and extensive use of advanced CSS properties.

Despite these challenges, the project provided valuable hands-on experience with real-world UI replication scenarios.

<h2> 🔎 Final Considerations 🔎 </h2>

This HBO Max UI clone represents an important milestone in my front-end learning journey.  
By focusing on layout, responsiveness, and visual fidelity, the project strengthened my understanding of modern CSS techniques and interface design patterns.

It also serves as a solid portfolio piece, demonstrating the ability to analyze, reproduce, and adapt complex user interfaces commonly found in production-level applications.
